# basic-networking
Code for my rudimentary python networking programs.

Please note that, as I am in the process of learning, my programs and scripts can appear poorly designed. For me, they simply serve a purpose.

At the moment, I am not concerned with algorithmic complexity, style, or readability. The functionality is the most important for me right now, and I think that these programs will serve as a great aid for cybersecurity learning.

In the future, though, I have plans on reflecting on this code so that I could mark my progress. However, if you have some valuable knowledge on how I can possibly better my code (which in my case is inevitable), I would be happy to hear from you!

Cheers.
